# CryptoClustering
HW19

In this challenge assignment, data about cryptocurrency was clustered using 2 methods.

Data was first scaled using the scikit learn Standard Scaler.

the optimal value for k was determined using the elbow method.  Using the optimal value of k, the model was fitted and predicted values were added to the dataframe.  finally, the clusters were plotted.

Then the above was repeated but with optimizing the clusters using PCA.

Finally the results were plotted on a composite plot to compare the 2 methods.  The clusters resulting using PCA were much tighter clusters.
